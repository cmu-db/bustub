 * ### Implementation
 *
 * We have implemented the constructor for you in a way that makes sense with our reference solution. You are free to
 * change anything you would like here if it doesn't fit with you implementation.
 *
 * Be warned, though! If you stray too far away from our guidance, it will be much harder for us to help you. Our
 * recommendation would be to first implement the buffer pool manager using the stepping stones we have provided.
 *
 * Once you have a fully working solution (all Gradescope test cases pass), then you can try more interesting things!
 *
 * @param num_frames The size of the buffer pool.
 * @param disk_manager The disk manager.
 * @param k_dist The backward k-distance for the LRU-K replacer.
 * @param log_manager The log manager. Please ignore this for P1.

 *
 * ### Implementation
 *
 * Think about all of the places a page or a page's metadata could be, and use that to guide you on implementing this
 * function. You will probably want to implement this function _after_ you have implemented `CheckedReadPage` and
 * `CheckedWritePage`.
 *
 * Ideally, we would want to ensure that all space on disk is used efficiently. That would mean the space that deleted
 * pages on disk used to occupy should somehow be made available to new pages allocated by `NewPage`.
 *
 * If you would like to attempt this, you are free to do so. However, for this implementation, you are allowed to
 * assume you will not run out of disk space and simply keep allocating disk space upwards in `NewPage`.
 *
 * For (nonexistent) style points, you can still call `DeallocatePage` in case you want to implement something slightly
 * more space-efficient in the future.

 * @brief Acquires an optional write-locked guard over a page of data. The user can specify an `AccessType` if needed.
 *
 * If it is not possible to bring the page of data into memory, this function will return a `std::nullopt`.
 *
 * Page data can _only_ be accessed via page guards. Users of this `BufferPoolManager` are expected to acquire either a
 * `ReadPageGuard` or a `WritePageGuard` depending on the mode in which they would like to access the data, which
 * ensures that any access of data is thread-safe.
 *
 * There can only be 1 `WritePageGuard` reading/writing a page at a time. This allows data access to be both immutable
 * and mutable, meaning the thread that owns the `WritePageGuard` is allowed to manipulate the page's data however they
 * want. If a user wants to have multiple threads reading the page at the same time, they must acquire a `ReadPageGuard`
 * with `CheckedReadPage` instead.
 *
 * ### Implementation
 *
 * There are 3 main cases that you will have to implement. The first two are relatively simple: one is when there is
 * plenty of available memory, and the other is when we don't actually need to perform any additional I/O. Think about
 * what exactly these two cases entail.
 *
 * The third case is the trickiest, and it is when we do not have any _easily_ available memory at our disposal. The
 * buffer pool is tasked with finding memory that it can use to bring in a page of memory, using the replacement
 * algorithm you implemented previously to find candidate frames for eviction.
 *
 * Once the buffer pool has identified a frame for eviction, several I/O operations may be necessary to bring in the
 * page of data we want into the frame.
 *
 * There is likely going to be a lot of shared code with `CheckedReadPage`, so you may find creating helper functions
 * useful.
 *
 * These two functions are the crux of this project, so we won't give you more hints than this. Good luck!
