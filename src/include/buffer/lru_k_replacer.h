 * LRUKReplacer implements the LRU-k replacement policy.

 * current timestamp and the timestamp of kth previous access.
 *
 * A frame with less than k historical references is given
 * +inf as its backward k-distance. When multiple frames have +inf backward k-distance,
 * classical LRU algorithm is used to choose victim.
