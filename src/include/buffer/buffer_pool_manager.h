/**
 * @brief A helper class for `BufferPoolManager` that manages a frame of memory and related metadata.
 *
 * This class represents headers for frames of memory that the `BufferPoolManager` stores pages of data into. Note that
 * the actual frames of memory are not stored directly inside a `FrameHeader`, rather the `FrameHeader`s store pointer
 * to the frames and are stored separately them.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Something that may (or may not) be of interest to you is why the field `data_` is stored as a vector that is
 * allocated on the fly instead of as a direct pointer to some pre-allocated chunk of memory.
 *
 * In a traditional production buffer pool manager, all memory that the buffer pool is intended to manage is allocated
 * in one large contiguous array (think of a very large `malloc` call that allocates several gigabytes of memory up
 * front). This large contiguous block of memory is then divided into contiguous frames. In other words, frames are
 * defined by an offset from the base of the array in page-sized (4 KB) intervals.
 *
 * In BusTub, we instead allocate each frame on its own (via a `std::vector<char>`) in order to easily detect buffer
 * overflow with address sanitizer. Since C++ has no notion of memory safety, it would be very easy to cast a page's
 * data pointer into some large data type and start overwriting other pages of data if they were all contiguous.
 *
 * If you would like to attempt to use more efficient data structures for your buffer pool manager, you are free to do
 * so. However, you will likely benefit significantly from detecting buffer overflow in future projects (especially
 * project 2).

 * faster access, and evicting unused or cold pages back out to storage.
