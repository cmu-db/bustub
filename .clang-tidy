#### Disabled checks and why: #####
#
# -bugprone-too-small-loop-variable,
#     Complains about uint8_t or uint16_t when the limit on the loop is a container's .size() (size_t).
#     We usually do this when we know the maximum size of the container though, so propose leaving disabled.
# -clang-analyzer-cplusplus.NewDelete,
#     Seems to generate false positives. Suggest relying on ASAN and valgrind for memory stuff.
# -clang-analyzer-cplusplus.NewDeleteLeaks,
#     Seems to generate false positives. Suggest relying on ASAN and valgrind for memory stuff.
# -modernize-use-nodiscard,
#     New C++17 feature, slightly polarizing. Would clutter codebase.
# -modernize-avoid-c-arrays,
#     We use C-style arrays in page.h, type.h and logger.h. They're a little more ergonomic than std::array. Thoughts?
# -readability-magic-numbers,
#     Let's not deal with people doing ridiculous things to hack around this. If it bites them, it bites them.
