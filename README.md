BusTub is a relational database management system built at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://db.cs.cmu.edu) for the [Introduction to Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu) (15-445/645) course. This system was developed for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments.

## Build

### Linux / Mac
To ensure that you have the proper packages installed on your machine, run `sudo build_support/packages.sh`. Then run

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Debug mode:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```
Debug build enables [AddressSanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers), which can generate false positives for overflow on STL containers. If you encounter this, define the environment variable `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_container_overflow=0`.

### Windows
If you are using a rather new version of Windows 10, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to develop, build, and test Bustub. All you need is to [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). You can just choose "Ubuntu" (no specific version) in Microsoft Store. Then, enter WSL and follow the above instructions.

If you are using CLion, it also [works with WSL](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2018/01/clion-and-linux-toolchain-on-windows-are-now-friends).


## Testing
```
cd build
make check-tests
```


## TODO
* update: when size exceed that page, table heap returns false and delete/insert tuple (rid will change and need to delete/insert from index)
* delete empty page from table heap when delete tuple
* implement delete table, with empty page bitmap in disk manager (how to persistent?)
* index: unique/dup key, variable key
