## TODO
* update: when size exceed that page, table heap returns false and delete/insert tuple (rid will change and need to delete/insert from index)
* delete empty page from table heap when delete tuple
* implement delete table, with empty page bitmap in disk manager (how to persistent?)
* index: unique/dup key, variable key
